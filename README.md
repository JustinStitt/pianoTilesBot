# pianoTilesBot
Image Recognition to play the Piano Tiles game!

My bot creates a Queue of all black squares on the screen by using sampling points.

If a sampling point has pixel value that is equivalent to black then it is added to the queue.

Then, a clicking-task is issued. Wherein, I pop elements off my Queue and click the pixel that was detected to be black.

**Real-Time Examples** (this website seems to play the timer twice as fast, I assure you this is in real-time)
